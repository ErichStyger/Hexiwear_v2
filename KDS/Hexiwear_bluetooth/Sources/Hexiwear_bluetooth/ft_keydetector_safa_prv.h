 /**

 * \ingroup detectors_private
 *
 * Safa key detector is a method for recognition of touch or release states. It can be used for each type of control.
 *
 * If the measured sample is reported as a valid sample, the module calculates the delta value from the actual signal value and
 * the baseline value. The delta value is compared to the threshold value computed from the expected signal and baseline values.
 * Based on the result, it determines the electrode state, which can be released, touched, changing from
 * released to touched, and changing from touched to released. The method is using moving average filters to determine the baseline and expected signal values 
 * with a different depth of the filter, depending on the state of the electrode. The deadband filters in the horizontal and vertical directions are also implemented.
