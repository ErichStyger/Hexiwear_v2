 /**
 * \defgroup safa Safa Detector
 * \ingroup detectors
 *
 * The Safa key detector is a method for recognizing the touch or release states. It can be used for each type of control.
 *
 * If the measured sample is reported as a valid sample, the module calculates the delta value from the actual signal and
 * baseline values. The delta value is compared to the threshold value computed from the expected signal and baseline values.
 * Based on the result, it determines the electrode state, which can be released, touched, changing from
 * released to touch, and changing from touched to release. This method is using moving average filters to determine the baseline and the expected signal values, 
 * with different depth of the filter, depending on the state of the electrode. The deadband filters in the horizontal and vertical directions are also implemented.

 * The default Safa settings of the key detector are:

 * - non_activity_avrg (FT_FILTER_MOVING_AVERAGE_MAX_ORDER by default, which means 65K samples) 
 * - entry_event_cnt (8 by default) 
 * - signal_to_noise_ratio (16 by default)
